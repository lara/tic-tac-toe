# Tic-Tac-To

## Bugs

[x] When a player makes an invalid input, her/his turn is over. Let's fix that!

## Improvements

[x] In the `GameHelper`, the `#calculate_win` has a predefined array of rows to
  check for the win condition. Let's make this scalable.
[ ] Let's write some specs.

## Styling

[x] `return` as the last statement in a Ruby method is redundant.
[ ] Let's discuss about linters (rubocop/reek).
